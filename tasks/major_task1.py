# Task 2: Write a program to perform matrix addition and matrix multiplication on two given matrices.
# Sample Input:
# Matrix A: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
# Matrix B: [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
# Sample Output: Sum = [[6, 8], [10, 12]], Product = [[19, 22], [43, 50]]

# Task 3: Create a program to find the longest word in a given file.
# Sample Input File Content: "Python programming is interesting."
# Sample Output: Longest word: "programming"

# Task 4: Develop a function that generates all prime numbers within a range and writes them to a file.
# Sample Input: Range 10 to 50
# Sample Output File Content: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47

# Task 5: Create a program that accepts a text file and calculates the frequency of each word, saving the result in another file.
# Sample Input File Content: "Hello world! Hello Python."
# Sample Output File Content: "Hello: 2, world: 1, Python: 1"

# Task 6: Create a function to parse a CSV file containing student records (name, marks in 3 subjects).
# Calculate the total and average marks for each student and write the result to another CSV file.
# Sample Input File Content:
# Name,Math,Science,English
# John,80,75,90
# Jane,85,95,80

# If duplicates exist, list the file names and sizes.
# No sample input/output required.

# Task 8: Create a program to zip all .txt files in a folder and extract them to another folder.
# No sample input/output required.

# Task 9: Write a program to generate a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a user-defined number.
# Save the results to a file and include the sum of all numbers in the sequence.
# Sample Input: 50
# Sample Output File Content: Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., 34. Sum: 88

# Task 10: Develop a function that finds all anagrams of a word in a given text file.
# Sample Input File Content: "listen silent enlist inlets"
# Sample Input Word: "listen"
# Sample Output: Anagrams: silent, enlist, inlets

# Task 11: Create a program to recursively list all files and folders in a directory and save the output to a file.
# Sample Output File Content:
# Folder: /example
# -- File: file1.txt
# -- File: file2.txt
# -- Folder: subfolder
# ---- File: file3.txt

# Task 12: Write a function to read a large file in chunks and calculate the number of occurrences of a specific word.
# Sample Input: File: "largefile.txt", Word: "Python"
# Sample Output: Occurrences of 'Python': 42

# Task 13: Create a program to merge the contents of multiple text files into one file without duplicates.
# Sample Input: file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt
# No sample output required.

# Task 14: Develop a program to validate email addresses from a text file.
# Save all valid email addresses to another file.
# Sample Input File Content: "test@example.com, invalid_email, hello@world.com"
# Sample Output File Content: "test@example.com, hello@world.com"

# Task 15: Write a program to generate a report of the top 5 most frequent characters in a file (excluding spaces).
# Sample Input File Content: "Hello World"
# Sample Output: Most frequent characters: l: 3, o: 2, e: 1, h: 1, r: 1

# Task 16: Create a function that reads a JSON file containing product details (name, price, quantity).
# Calculate the total value of all products and save it to another JSON file.
# Sample Input File Content: [{"name": "A", "price": 10, "quantity": 2}, {"name": "B", "price": 20, "quantity": 1}]
# Sample Output File Content: {"Total Value": 40}

# Task 17: Write a program to encrypt and decrypt a file using a basic cipher (e.g., Caesar cipher).
# Sample Input File Content: "Python is fun"
# Sample Output File Content (Encrypted): "Sbwkrq lv ixq"

# Task 18: Create a program that simulates a simple text-based to-do list application using file operations.
# Options: Add task, View tasks, Delete task, Mark task as complete.
# No sample input/output required.

# Task 19: Write a program to monitor changes in a folder (new file creation, deletion, modification) and log the changes.
# No sample input/output required.

# Task 20: Develop a program to split a large text file into smaller files, each containing a maximum of N lines.
# Sample Input: File: "largefile.txt", Lines per file: 100
# No sample output required.
